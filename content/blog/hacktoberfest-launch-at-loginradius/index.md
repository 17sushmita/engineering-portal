## Have you ever thought what would be the world like if open source didn't exist?

It's hard to imagine a world without open source these days. Open source powers the biggest organizations of today's world. Open source software like [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) runs most of today's servers and also powers the [Android Operating System](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)>).

## Introducing Hacktoberfest 2020

#### In a gist hacktoberfest is a festival of "giving back to community".

Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software in October month run by DigitalOcean in partnership with GitHub and DEV. Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!

**From Official Website:**

> Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community. Whether youâ€™re new to development, a student, long-time contributor, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skills levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.

The purpose of this month-long celebration is to get people started in open source as well as give back to the open source community.

It is the easiest way to get into open source for people who have never contributed to open source community or find it difficult to contribute.

### How to contribute in Hacktoberfest?

Any one can contribute in hacktoberfest by registering at [hacktoberfest website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) anytime between 1st October to 31st October.

During this time anyone who wishes to be part of this month-long fest needs to open four quality pull requests on any of the open source projects on Github.

### How to find Projects?

Finding projects can be a bit challenging. It can be the tools you are already using or there are different tools that can be used to find the issues based on different labels. Tools like [http://issuehub.io/](http://issuehub.io/) are really helpful for the same.

This year [LoginRadius](https://www.loginradius.com/) is going to be part of Hacktoberfest by open-sourcing a lot of it's projects and accepting contributions including it's [Engineering Blog](https://www.loginradius.com/engineering/blog).

We will soon share a list of our Projects on our Blog.
Stay tuned!
