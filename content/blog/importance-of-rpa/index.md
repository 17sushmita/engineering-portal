Robotic process automation(RPA) process to get the repetitive tasks done through bots and reduce manual efforts.

In definitive words we can say **“Impersonating human activities in a sequential fashion to achieve a designated result without any manual intervention is known as Robotic Process Automation.”**

## Why is RPA becoming an important part of every business ?
There are many benefits of robotic process automation depending on the industries. I have listed a few common benefits across all the business domains and industries. 

 ### A Desideratum
Success of any business depends on how deep they understand the customers or rather I should say **targeted customers**. And this is one of the important challenges for the companies.

An intelligent automation through RPA can be implemented to understand the user behavior and that can help companies in decision making for their targeted customers and growth.

### Cost Effective
RPA is definitely the most sought after solution in this technological driven era to reduce the investment being done on manual tasks and getting the best of the employees by giving them the opportunity to innovate rather than doing monotonous work. Multiple studies say that by rolling out RPA and thoughtful implementation can save approx 30-35% of companies' costs being spent on non-productive and repetitive tasks.

### Undefeatable Accuracy
A report by ICO (Information Commissioner’s office) says that 90% of data breach between 2017 and 2018 happened due to human error. Human minds have certain limitations, we can’t always be attentive 100%. And the moment we lose attention we become vulnerable to make mistakes.
But Robots once defined/built can have unlimited attention and can work endlessly without any distractions. And that gives the ability of making no mistakes.
 
### Raising the Bar On Productivity
Humans have their own limitations, capacity to work. But robots on the other hand have no measure of capacity. If developed smartly they can work for every millisecond. And this gives unlimited possibilities for any company to run their businesses without worrying about productivity.

## Use cases in different industries/domains

### RPA in Business Process Outsourcing
Business process outsourcing(BPO) always strives for heftiness in productivity with minimal cost. With the efficient use of RPA the BPO’s can eventually reduce a lot of operating costs and can make more effective utilization of their workforce. As robots can work 24/7 the productivity can be increased tremendously. Apart from repetitive work automation, the industry also has a lot of back office work which is purely rule-based and the same can be achieved with better security and audits. Report generation, data analysis are the other tasks which can also be done through RPA. Some more examples can be 
- Data entry and validation
- Data extraction
- Creating mass emails
- Updating CRMs
- Updating scorecards
- Automated exchange of information

### RPA in Banking
Most innovations along with technology advancement have been seen in the banking sector. As per the reports BFSI domain holds the largest share in year 2019 for application of RPA. 
RPA has a surfeit of applications in banking covering from customer service to compliance nearly everything. Following are the few examples. 
- Customer Service
- KYC process
- Mortgage processing
- Reporting
- General ledger
- Fraud detection
- Compliances

### RPA in Medical Industry
Medical industry across the globe has always been a sector which is continuously striving for improvement. Providing the best health care services for a large range of population is a real challenge in both operational and organisational. There are numerous of the use-cases in the medical industry where patients and hospital both can leverage the benefits.
Such as :
- Scheduling the appointments
- Managing the supply process like claims and billing
- Regulatory compliances optimisation

### RPA in Insurance
Insurance is an industry which deals with huge amounts of data and processes. With the help RPA insurance providers are now capable of merging front-end and back-end operations resulting in reducing cost and manual intervention.
*Leslie Willcocks* professor at LSE said that *“In an insurer we studied, there was a particular process where it used to take two days to handle 500 premium advice notes. It now takes 30 minutes”*
This much processing was made by implementing RPA. Apart from the front-end or back-end automation there can be many other use-cases, for example
- Valuation and structuring of claims
- Regulatory compliances
- Policy cancellation
- New policy issuance


### Conclusion
There are many more benefits of robotic process automation depending on the industries.
A survey by Deloitte says that RPA continues to meet and exceed expectations across multiple dimensions including :
92% on Improved Compliance
90% Improved quality and accuracy
86% improvement in productivity and 
59% cost reduction.
  
They say that ***with the current pace RPA will have achieved near-universal adoption within the next 5 years.***
