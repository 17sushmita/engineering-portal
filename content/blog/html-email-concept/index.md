There are two types of email you can send and receive, that are plain text emails (any email that contains just plain old text with no formatting) and HTML emails, these are formatted and styled using HTML and inline CSS.
HTML email is the use of a subset of HTML to provide formatting and semantic markup capabilities in email that are not available with plain text.

An HTML email is designed just like a website with the help of graphics, table columns, colors and links. You don't need to be a programmer to create it since email marketing services provide flexible campaign builders. Email client vendors have not been as developing as web browser vendors in adopting new standards. 

**Definition**

Email that is formatted using Hypertext Markup Language(HTML), as opposed to plain text email.

**How to Create an HTML Email**

There are many tools that create and send email will offer pre-formatted, already built HTML templates that allows you to design emails without knowing or accessing any code of back-end.

The best way to understand any process is to carry it out yourself, from the zero level. As We make any changes in the email editor, those changes will be automatically coded into the final result. This email building tools is a best option if you don't have an email designer, but you still want to send any professional  marketing emails.

If want more control over the code of your emails and you are comfortable with HTML(that is just basic and easy), most email tools will allow you to import HTML files directly for using it as custom email templates. They have a wide variety of free HTML email templates available on the internet and if you are fimiliar with HTML, it is a straightforward process to use that template to the email building tool of your own choice.

To create an HTML email from scratch, you will need to have an advanced knowledge of HTML. Because creating an HTML email from scratch can be quite difficult, we recommend you working with a developer for this process or you may go with template for easy process.

**If you choose to code your HTML email by hand-code, there are following things needs to use during creating HTML email:**

10. Use “line-height and font-size” 1pixel under “<TD>” where you place the space images.
11. Use inline style for the text in each “<TD>”.
